Create API with MinimalApi approach. 

Things To Do!

1. Make first request to get all ToDos (take data from memory)on
   - Take a look  Jakub Kozera repo and try to reproduce same configuration for endpoints (without validation) - Done
   - MediatR (create Infrastructure and Application layer) -- in progress - creating ToDo use case (all interfaces should go to Building Blocks) - done
   - Repository should be mocked too - done
2. Add automapping between RequestDto and Query (Creating To Do Case)
3. Implement extension method for Execute usecases (.MapPostToCommand<Dto,Command,Result>) - done
4. Add Validation for Dtos
5. Map errors to Http codes (Problem details) (For now Validation Error for Validate Dtos. Bad Request)
6. Add persistance layer (with transactional support) 
7. Write tests for Domain and UseCase Layer
8. Add UseCase Get All To Dos
9. Add other usecases (Complete to do, uncomplete, delete )
10. Write periodically job for fetching To Dos (Hangfire ? Or maybe other solution)
11. Write first aspect (start with Exception Handling)
12. Write other Aspects (Logging and Caching)
13. Think about how to configure Infrastructure layer (how to make extensions like plugins and convey builder)
14. Code style (.editorConfig)

Decision (notes):
- Create own command and query handling instead of using MediatR. I don't want to relay on external library (all stuffs that i need i can write by myself). 
  Advg:
      - clean code, without any external dependencies (so i don't need to reference MediatR in all projects)
      - separated pipelines for queries and commands (MediatR always have one pipeline for all stuffs)
