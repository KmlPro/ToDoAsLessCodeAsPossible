Create API with MinimalApi approach. 

Things To Do!

1. Make first request to get all ToDos (take data from memory)
   - Take a look on Jakub Kozera repo and try to reproduce same configuration for endpoints (without validation)
   - MediatR (create Infrastructure and Application layer)
   - Repository should be mocked too
   - Write Api test to make easier testing :)
2. Try to add automapping between Dto and Query (Get by Id case)
3. Try add domain layer and add Command for Create Dto (still with mocked Repository). But they should throw domain expections and application
4. Map errors to Http codes (Problem details)
4. Add persistance layer (with transactional support) (there i need to fix test to use mocked repositories instead of real db. Maybe in memory database ?)
5. Think about how to configure Infrastructure layer (how to make extensions like plugins and convey builder)


At the end, i want to have template to create minimal api.
